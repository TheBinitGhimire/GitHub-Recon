# GitHub Recon

### GitHub Recon — and what you can achieve with it!

"**GitHub Recon — and what you can achieve with it!**", or simply "**GitHub Recon**", is a topic on which I usually give talks at different events. The contents being presented and demonstrated at each event might be similar, same or updated from the predecessor event/s.

This repository is built to provide the resources focused into my talks on this topic at every event.
